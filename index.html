        </li>
        <li><p>In case I wish to return the new phone I bought in the Exchange Offer, will my old phone be shipped back to me?</p>

        <p>Kindly ensure all your data is backed up and cleared from your old phone before exchange. You may also remove the memory card. Xiaomi or its affiliates will not be responsible for any misuse as a result.
        In the event the device is not working or the delivery executive is not able to do an unlock check or screen lock check / IMEI check due to a phone being “factory reset”, the exchange might not go through at the doorstep.</p>
